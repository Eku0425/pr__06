# ðŸš€ ðŸŒŒ Space App: 

# Description:

ðŸ‘‰Imports and Setup: Import necessary packages (flutter/material.dart) and set up a basic Flutter app (PlanetsApp) with an app bar and a main widget (PlanetDetails).

âœ¨AnimatedContainer: Inside PlanetDetails, use AnimatedContainer as the main widget. It animates changes to its properties like width, height, and borderRadius based on _isLarge state.

âœ¨State Management: _PlanetDetailsState manages the _isLarge boolean state. Tapping on the container toggles _isLarge, triggering the animation due to setState().

âœ¨GestureDetector: Wraps the AnimatedContainer to detect taps and call _toggleSize to change _isLarge.

âœ¨Animation Properties: duration specifies how long the animation should take (1 second in this case), and curve defines the animation's speed curve (here, Curves.fastOutSlowIn for a smooth transition).

âœ¨Decoration and Child: AnimatedContainer decorates with a blue color and rounded corners (borderRadius). Its child (Text) changes based on _isLarge state.

This example demonstrates a basic use of animation with AnimatedContainer in Flutter, which you can adapt and expand upon for your planets app.
